# A Journey to Improve Neural Architecture Search: Advancements in Neural Architecture Transfer and Once-For-All

This work is based on [Once-For-All](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09791) ([GitHub](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/once-for-all)) and [Neural Architecture Transfer](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9328602/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/human-analysis/neural-architecture-transfer)).

This repository contains the code and scripts to run the experiments, as well as those to collect and analyse the results.
